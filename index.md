#Aman's First CS193 Homework

Hi, my name is Aman and I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst and Data Analytics major. I am a freshman and am currently a member of the data mine. I love anything Formula 1, soccer, and NFl related. At Purdue, I want to continue to study CS (main major), while minoring in something that is data-related.

- I like how CS193 is simple
- I like how CS193 is helping me prepare for CS 240 and beyond
